# Introduction to MySQL and SQL Queries

Welcome to the MySQL and SQL Queries Learning Experience! This README outlines my journey of exploring and mastering MySQL, a popular relational database management system, and the art of crafting powerful SQL queries. This knowledge was acquired during the initial weeks of the IT Academy.

## Learning Objectives

In this phase of my IT Academy training, I focused on the following key aspects of MySQL and SQL queries:

- **Database Fundamentals:** Gained a strong understanding of relational database concepts, tables, rows, and relationships.
- **MySQL Installation:** Set up and configured MySQL on my local machine to create databases and perform SQL operations.
- **Data Manipulation:** Learned to insert, update, and delete data within tables using SQL statements.
- **Data Retrieval:** Mastered the art of querying databases to retrieve specific data, utilizing SELECT statements with various clauses.
- **Filtering and Sorting:** Practiced using WHERE clauses to filter results and ORDER BY clauses to sort them.
- **Aggregation and Grouping:** Explored aggregate functions like COUNT, SUM, AVG, and GROUP BY to analyze data.
- **Joins and Relationships:** Understood different types of joins (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT) to combine data from multiple tables.
- **Subqueries:** Delved into subqueries, enabling more complex and targeted data retrieval.
- **Data Modification:** Explored ALTER TABLE statements to modify table structures when necessary.

## Practical Application

During this learning phase, I worked on real-world scenarios and projects to apply my understanding of MySQL and SQL queries. I created and manipulated databases, crafted intricate queries to extract meaningful insights, and refined my skills through hands-on exercises.
